| Null (H0)  | The standard 3-pool model captures soil C dynamics better than   'microbially explicit' (forward or reverse kinetic) models | Model comparison and   cross-validation against soil microcosm incubation dataset |
| H1         | Microbially explicit models capture soil C dynamics better than   'micobially implicit' (standard) model                    | Model comparison and   cross-validation against soil microcosm incubation dataset |
| H2         | Under conditions of substrate limitation the system behaves as a   reverse-kinetic model                                    |                                                                                   |
| H2A        | System 'switches' from forward to reverse kinetics over time as substrate   is depleted in microcosms                       | Change-point model                                                                |
| H2B        | Switch' to reverse kinetics happens faster under higher temperatures   (since substrate is depleted more quickly)           | Change-point model                                                                |
| H3         | Kinetic parameters depend on initial substrate pool sizes (i.e. the site   form which the soil originated)                  | Hierarchical model                                                                |
